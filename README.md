# Commitment to Transparency
Creobase is dedicated to maintaining transparency in its policy updates. To facilitate this, we have chosen GitHub as our platform for hosting and version controlling our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and other public documents. This approach allows users and the public to easily access and track changes, revisions, and amendments to our documents.

By making these changes visible and easily comparable on GitHub, we aim to demystify policy updates and empower our users with clear, accessible information about the evolution of our policies, reinforcing our commitment to transparency and trust.

Any questions or issues please contact us at support@creobase.com
