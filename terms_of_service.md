Intellectual Property Infringement Policy

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask our users to do the same. Our policy is to promptly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement. We take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Copyright Act, and other applicable intellectual property laws in response to any alleged or actual infringement.

When removing or disabling access in response to a notice, we attempt to contact the affected member, providing information about the notice and removal. In cases of alleged copyright infringement, we also provide information on submitting a counter-notice. We may share a copy of the infringement notice, including the reporter's name and email, with the affected member.

To report alleged infringement, email hello@creobase.com with:
(a) Your signature (electronic or physical) as the copyright or intellectual property owner's authorized agent.
(b) A description of the infringed work or property.
(c) The location of the alleged infringement on our Service, including the URL.
(d) Your contact information (address, telephone, email).
(e) A statement of good faith belief that the use is unauthorized.
(f) A statement under penalty of perjury that your information is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.

We may request additional information before processing a notice. Notices we believe are false, fraudulent, incomplete, or in bad faith may be rejected. Abusers of this policy may face legal consequences.

Counter-Notice for Copyright Notices
If you believe content removed or disabled is not infringing, or you have authorization to post and use the content, send a counter-notice to our Copyright Agent with:
(a) Your signature (physical or electronic).
(b) Identification of the content removed or disabled and its previous location.
(c) A statement of good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification.
(d) Your contact information and consent to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California's federal court.

If we receive a counter-notice, we inform the original complainant that we may restore the content in 10 to 14 business days, unless the copyright owner seeks a court order against the content provider, member, or user.

You may face damages for misrepresentation or bad-faith claims about infringement. If unsure about infringement, consult an attorney before submitting a notice or counter-notice.
